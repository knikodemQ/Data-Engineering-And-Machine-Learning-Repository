This project demonstrates comprehensive housing market analysis using the California Housing Dataset from the "Hands-On Machine Learning" book. It showcases professional data science workflow including data acquisition, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and preparation for machine learning modeling.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Data Acquisition**: Download and extract housing data from remote TGZ archives
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Understand housing market patterns and distributions
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful derived features for enhanced analysis
- **Geographic Analysis**: Explore spatial patterns in housing prices and characteristics
- **Statistical Insights**: Generate actionable insights for real estate applications
- **Data Preparation**: Create clean, modeling-ready datasets

## 📊 Dataset

**Source**: California Housing Dataset (Aurélien Géron - Hands-On Machine Learning)
- **Format**: CSV data compressed in TGZ archive
- **Size**: ~20,000 housing districts in California
- **Time Period**: Based on 1990 California census data

### Features:
- `longitude`, `latitude`: Geographic coordinates
- `housing_median_age`: Median age of houses in district
- `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`: Room counts
- `population`, `households`: Population metrics
- `median_income`: Median income (in tens of thousands)
- `median_house_value`: Target variable (house prices)
- `ocean_proximity`: Categorical proximity to ocean

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 1. **Automated Data Acquisition**
```python
# Downloads from remote URL and handles TGZ extraction
download_and_extract_housing_data(url, data_path)
```

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
- `rooms_per_household`: Average rooms per household
- `bedrooms_per_room`: Room utilization ratio
- `population_per_household`: Household density
- Income and price categorization

### 3. **Comprehensive Visualizations**
- Geographic scatter plots with price coloring
- Distribution histograms for key features
- Correlation matrix heatmaps
- Box plots for categorical analysis

### 4. **Statistical Analysis**
- Price distribution analysis
- Geographic price patterns
- Ocean proximity impact assessment
- Feature correlation analysis

## 📈 Key Insights

### Price Patterns
- **Average Price**: ~$206k (1990 dollars)
- **Geographic Clustering**: Clear coastal premium
- **Income Correlation**: Strong positive relationship (r ≈ 0.69)

### Geographic Impact
- **Ocean Proximity**: Significant price differential by location
- **Latitude/Longitude**: Clear geographic clustering of prices
- **Hotspots**: Bay Area and coastal regions show highest values

### Feature Importance
1. **Median Income**: Strongest predictor
2. **Geographic Location**: Latitude/longitude significant
3. **Ocean Proximity**: Clear categorical impact
4. **Engineered Features**: rooms_per_household adds value
