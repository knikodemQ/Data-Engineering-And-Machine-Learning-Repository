# Project 08: Regression Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates various regression techniques to model polynomial data, comparing different algorithms and their effectiveness in capturing non-linear patterns. The analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of model performance using training and test metrics.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Compare different regression algorithms on polynomial data
- Evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Visualize regression models and their predictions
- Understand the trade-offs between model complexity and generalization
- Identify the optimal model for polynomial pattern recognition

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses synthetic data generated with:
- A 4th-degree polynomial function: y = 1x⁴ + 2x³ + 1x² - 4x + 2
- Random noise added to simulate real-world variation
- 300 data points spanning the range of -2.5 to 2.5
- 80/20 train-test split for robust evaluation

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Regression Models Implemented:

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Simple linear model (y = wx + b)
   - Baseline for comparison
   - Expected limitations with non-linear data

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression**
   - Non-parametric approach
   - Multiple k values tested (3, 5, 7, 15)
   - Local pattern recognition capability

3. **Polynomial Regression**
   - Feature transformation using polynomial basis functions
   - Degrees tested: 2, 3, 4, 5
   - Capturing non-linear relationships

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Training Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Test Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Test/Train MSE Ratio (for overfitting detection)

### Visualization Components:
- Initial data scatter plot
- Individual model performance plots
- Comparative bar charts of MSE values
- Best model visualization

## 📈 Key Results and Insights

### Performance Comparison:
- **Linear Regression**: High MSE due to inability to model non-linear patterns
- **KNN Models**: Performance varies with k value; smaller k values tend to overfit
- **Polynomial Models**: Best performance with degree matching the underlying data pattern

### Model Selection Insights:
1. **Underfitting**: Linear model fails to capture data complexity
2. **Optimal Fit**: Polynomial degree 4 likely best matches data generation process
3. **Overfitting Risk**: Higher degree polynomials may overfit, especially with limited data
4. **Flexibility vs. Stability**: Trade-off between KNN flexibility and polynomial stability
